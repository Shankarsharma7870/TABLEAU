The tableau project is a visualization of various aspects related to space launches. The project includes data on launch site temperatures, humidity, wind speed, track records, launch vehicle details, and mission status.

The data is presented in various ways, including pie charts, bar charts, and box plots. The project is well-designed and easy to understand. It provides a comprehensive overview of the data and allows for easy comparison of different launch sites, companies, and mission outcomes.

Launch Site Temperatures: The pie chart shows the average temperature at different launch sites, with Marshall Islands having the highest temperature at 86 degrees.

Launch Site Humidity: The pie chart shows the average humidity at different launch sites, with Guiana Space Centre having the highest humidity at 94%.

Track Records: The bar chart shows the number of successful and failed missions for different companies, with SpaceX having the most successful missions at 88.

Launch Vehicle Details: The table shows the number of times different launch vehicles have been used.

Mission Status: The bar chart shows the number of successful and failed missions for different companies, with SpaceX having the most successful missions at 88.

Launch Site Wind Speed: The box plot shows the distribution of wind speed at different launch sites.
